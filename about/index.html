	<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b>I am a creative technologist and multi-media experience designer.</b></p>

	<p>I help designers and artists achieve their vision and tell their story using experiential tools and technology. My work ranges from small self-contained pieces to large-scale complex integrated multimedia systems. I also create my own mixed-media artwork.</p>

	<p>I've lived, studied, and worked in France, the Netherlands, and the United States. I have over ten years' experience as a designer and engineer for the built environment, managing and delivering a  variety of physical and digital projects from concept to implementation.</p>

	<p style="height: 3em;">I'd love to hear about your new <span class="your-thing">project</span>.</p>

	<p>Get in touch: <span class="email"></span></p>
