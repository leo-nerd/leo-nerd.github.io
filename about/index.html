	<p style="margin-top: 3em;"><b>I am a senior experience designer and multi-media technologist.</b></p>

	<p>
		I help designers, artists, and visionaries like you tell meaningful stories in the built environment using experiential tools and technology, from small self-contained pieces to large-scale integrated narrative environments and multi-media systems.
		I care deeply about how users engage with physical space and believe that carefully coordinated design can achieve sustainable, rewarding, and heightened experiences for everyone.
	</p> 

	<p>
		I've lived, studied, and worked in France, the Netherlands, and the United States.
		I have over ten years' experience as a designer and engineer for the built environment, delivering a wide range of experiential and cultural projects from concept to implementation.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a founding member of Collective Scope, a mixed-media artist group. We develop site-specific multi-media installations aimed at challenging our incumbent relationships with more-than-human agents in urban environments.
