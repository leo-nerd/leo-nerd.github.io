<p>This semi-enclosed architectural space made of bare concrete provided a canvas for our ongoing experimentation around sequences and musical canons as interpreted with light, sound, and physical material.</p>

<p>The piece features large fabric structures drawn inside the architectural volume, intersecting interwoven lighting patterns and an 8-channel soundscape spanning along the length of the space, each providing an interpretation of the canon at its own scale.</p>

<p>Designed and produced in collaboration with lighting designer Susheela Sankaram and architect Sophie Valla.</p>
