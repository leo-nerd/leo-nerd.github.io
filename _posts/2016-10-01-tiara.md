<div class="project-narrative">
<p>
The Tippet Rise Art Center is a unique destination for art and music located on a pristine 10,000-acre land in rural Montana. Arup was commissioned to design the music performance spaces and provide technical expertise on some of the sculptures installed throughout the site.
</p>

<p>
One of these performance spaces, Tiara, is an outdoor music shell that was designed to meet the unique constraints of providing the best acoustic experience while maintaining the breahtaking views, and be built by local barn building artisans.
</p>

<p>
The design was led by Willem Boning and Alban Bassuet at Arup. I helped influence the architectural design of the shell by running optimization algorithms to maximize the amount of sound reflected from the band to the audience by the wood surfaces using custom acoustic simulation tools in Grasshopper.
