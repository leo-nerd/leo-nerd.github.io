<p>
	After its opening in 2019 <a href="https://publicrecords.nyc/">Public Records</a> in Brooklyn quickly became one of the most sought-after locations for audiophiles and clubbers in the city.
</p>
	
<p>
	The <b>Sound Room</b>, one of the two spaces in the venue at the time of the opening, was designed for optimal acoustics and to live up to its name. It features a high-end four-point sound system (originally built by Global Audio Systems for the nearby club Analog) and custom-fabricated wood-based acoustic finishes on the walls and ceiling.
</p>

<p>
	I participated in the acoustic design of the Sound Room by performing the initial acoustic measurements and acoustic study, part of the Acoustics team at Arup (with acousticians Helen Searle and Terence Caulkins). We provided recommendations for acoustic finishes, sound isolation, and bass control in the public and DJ areas.
