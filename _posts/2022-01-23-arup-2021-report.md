<div class="project-narrative">

<p>
	Arup's public <a href="https://www.arup.com/annual-report-2021/">2021 activity report</a> features 6 original binaural soundscapes to accompany the visual content and enhance the reader's experience.
</p>
	
<p>
	The 5 soundscapes are crafted as sonifications and interpretations of actual data from each of the 5 featured projects from around the world. They are composed spatially and rendered in binaural (to be played over headphones).
</p>

<p>
	I led the sound design work in collaboration with Marcus Webb and Ryan Cox and each of the project teams, with art direction from Raj Patel and Gideon D'Arcangelo at Arup.
