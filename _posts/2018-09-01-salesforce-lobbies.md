<p>Massively-multichannel immersive soundscapes composed and produced for the lobbies of the newly open Salesforce towers in New York and San Francisco, part of a branding initiative supported by multiple AV technologies designed by Arup. The soundscape is inspired by the fauna and flora of redwood forests in Northern California.</p>

<p>These soundscapes can be experienced in the ground-floor lobbies of 3 Bryant Park in New York and 415 Mission Street in San Francisco</p>
