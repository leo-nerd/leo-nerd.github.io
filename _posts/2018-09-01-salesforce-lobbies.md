<div class="project-narrative">
<p>These <b>massively-multichannel immersive soundscapes</b> were composed and produced for the lobbies of the newly open Salesforce towers in New York and San Francisco, part of a branding initiative supported by multiple AV technologies designed by Arup. The soundscape is inspired by the fauna and flora of redwood forests in Northern California.</p>

<p>These soundscapes can be experienced in the ground-floor lobbies of the Salesforce Towers in New York (3 Bryant Park) and San Francisco (415 Mission Street).</p>
