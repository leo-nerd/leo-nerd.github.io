<p><i>What would the biotechnical revolution hold if we were to de-center the human when envisioning its promise and considering risks and responsibilities?<br/>How might we imagine partnerships with unusual organisms for collaborative survival on our changing planet?</i></p>
<p><i>Scales: Theater of Collaborative Survival</i> builds upon the work developed for <a href="{{site.url}}{% link _posts/2019-05-01-scope.md %}">Scope</a> with biologist <a href="http://elizabeth-henaff.net/">Elizabeth HÃ©naff</a> and multimedia artist <a href="https://heatherparrish.net/home.html">Heather Parrish</a>. The installation proposed is an <b>interactive, human-scale bioreactor</b> featuring video imagery and live growing sediment. The audiovisual landscape is generative and responds to occupants of the space.
