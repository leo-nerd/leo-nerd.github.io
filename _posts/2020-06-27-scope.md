<p><i>Scope: Theater of Collaborative Survival</i> explores the relationship organisms have with their environment through the notions of toxicity, repair, and evolution over various scales of time and space. It is a mixed-media installation co-created with biologist <a href="http://elizabeth-henaff.net/">Elizabeth HÃ©naff</a> and multimedia artist <a href="https://heatherparrish.net/home.html">Heather Parrish</a>. It features interpretive tokens of human and microbial activity and their interactions: jars of Gowanus Canal sediment (Brooklyn, NY) and live laser microscopy of its inhabitants, photoreactive prints of multi-scale living environments, and generative multi-channel sonification of algorithmically-generated populations evolving at different time scales.
