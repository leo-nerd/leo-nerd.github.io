description: Site-specific light and sound activation of Passage Thiaffait
---

<div class="project-narrative">
<p>This installation is centered around the idea of repetition of sequences and machine-generated patterns. As a response to Lyonâ€™s historically thriving textile industry, the piece is an activation of Passage Thiaffait, a transitional courtyard-like public space, and features twelve custom fixtures emitting light through revolving strips of perforated textile to project complex patterns sequences on the ground. An array of loudspeakers projects a multichannel sound component that is also machine generated.</p>

<p>Designed and produced in collaboration with lighting designer Susheela Sankaram and architect Sophie Valla.</p>
