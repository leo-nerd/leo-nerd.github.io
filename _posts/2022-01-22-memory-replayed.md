	<i>What is the relationship between reality and our memories of that reality?</i>
</p>

<p>
	This piece, developed in collaboration with neuroscientists Oliver Vikbladh and Olivier HÃ©naff, invites the user to draw parallels between lived experience and the memory therof, and witness the expression of memory via multisensory cues.
</p>

<p>
	The piece is organized in a dual <b>play/replay</b> mechanism: <br/>
In the play phase, as the user wanders through the space, they generate light and sound patterns that are registered as a signature of their passage through the space.<br/>
In the replay phase they can observe the sequence they activated and re-live their experience through those light and sound perceptual cues.<br/> The audiovisual field that is replayed, however, is an idealized version of their past experience, akin to how memory tends to filter out non-crucial details of reality.

	Its first implementation was made public in November 2021 at St Saviours Church (<a href="http://www.florencetrust.net/">The Florence Trust</a>) in London.
