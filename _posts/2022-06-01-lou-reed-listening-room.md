	<a href="https://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/lou-reed">Lou Reed: Caught Between the Twisted Stars</a>, the largest Lou Reed retrospective to date, opened in June 2022 at the <b>New York Public Library for the Performing Arts</b>. It features an extensive collection of artifacts from Lou Reed's archive donated entirely to the Public Library, and a bespoke listening space: the <b>Lou Reed Listening Room</b>.
</p>
	
<p>
	The <b>Lou Reed Listening Room</b>, hosted in the <b>Vincent Astor Gallery</b>, is a large listening space dedicated to experiencing various sound works by Lou Reed in their original intended audio formats. It features a <b>13.4 sound system</b> able to play back a variety of audio formats including mono, stereo, quadraphonic, and full-sphere ambisonics. The audio and visual content curation is refreshed monthly.
</p>

<p>
	I led the production of the technical systems for the piece, and the design and programming of its video systems and content.
