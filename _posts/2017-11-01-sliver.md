<p>This piece by mixed-media artist <a href="https://www.catherineowens.net/">Catherine Owens</a> is centered around a migrant from Guatemala to the United States telling her traveling story. The audio piece weaves her narration with fragments of birdsong and a music composition by <a href="https://www.donnachadennehy.com/">Donnacha Dennehy</a>, and was spatialized over a 9-channel ambisonics system installed at gallery Kustera Projects in Red Hook in fall-winter 2017, featuring paintings by the artist.</p>

<p>Produced and installed in collaboration with Devin Bean in the Arup SoundLab in New York.</p>
