<div class="project-narrative">
<p>For six months in 2012 I joined the Acoustic and Cognitive Spaces team at Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique (IRCAM) in Paris in their research on the measurement, analysis, and synthesis of 3D acoustic signatures of spaces (room impulse responses).</p>

<p>In particular, I developed software to automate data processing and analysis of room impulse responses captured with high-density spherical microphones (over 500 audio channels), simulate such impulse responses, listen comparatively in the IRCAM studios and performance space, and explore advanced spatial audio processing techniques such as sound field transformations and source separation.</p>

<p>This research aims to further improve the development of the <i>Spatialisateur</i>, IRCAM's industry-leading spatial audio software widely used by musicians and designers.</p>
