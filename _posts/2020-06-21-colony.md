<p>In 2014 Arup was commissioned by David Benjamin (<a href="http://www.thelivingnewyork.com/">The Living</a>) for the structural engineering of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hy-Fi</span>, a piece featured in the MoMA PS1 courtyard (Long Island City, New York) as laureate of the 2014 Young Architects Program. The piece is a large edifice constructed with compostable bricks. Some of the bricks were transported to the Arup New York office after the exhibit and were assembled into four helicoidal towers. A four-channel audio track was distributed across the towers, composed using textures built from organic (human and vegetal) and mineral elements.</p>

<p>Designed and produced in collaboration with sound designer Terence Caulkins.</p>
