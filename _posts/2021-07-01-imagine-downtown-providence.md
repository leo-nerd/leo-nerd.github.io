description: Visualizations / auralizations for urban design

<div class="project-narrative">
<p>Part of the revitalization of the main downtown area in Providence (Rhode Island, USA), Arup worked with the City, local communities, and many design partners to develop a unified vision at the concept design phase. The team was comprised of architects, lighting designers, landscape architects, urban planners, user experience designers, and audiovisual systems engineers, to name a few.</p>

<p>I helped create <b>two series of visualizations / auralizations</b> to facilitate a series of public engagement meetings during which the design ideas were presented and feedback was collected: a site <b>fly-through video</b> presenting the main design elements, and an <b>interactive walk-through experience with immersive audio</b>, both shown <a href="#media">below</a>.</p>

<p>On the production side, the work involved intensive 3D modeling and rendering for this large-scale site, present-day 360Â° audio and photo capture, composition of full-3D soundscapes to help describe the experience on the future site, and development of the interactive web app. This was done in collaboration with Anthony Cortez, Terence Caulkins, Ryan Cox, and Rick Gao at Arup, among others.</p>
