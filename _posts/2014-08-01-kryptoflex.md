<div class="project-narrative">
<p>Sound performance with my long-time friend <a href="https://www.olivierhenaff.com/">Olivier Hénaff</a>. At the time he was a computational neuroscience PhD student at NYU and I was an acoustic engineering intern. The performance used recorded and synthesized sound textures as Moiré-inspired projected visuals were generated in response.</p>
