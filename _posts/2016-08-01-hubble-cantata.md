<p>It was premiered during Celebrate! Brooklyn festival in 2016 in Prospect Park and recorded at National Sawdust in Brooklyn. The final scene, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fistful of Stars</span>, features a short animated film in virtual reality directed by <a href="http://www.elizamcnitt.com/">Eliza McNitt</a> and produced by <a href="https://theendless.co/">The Endless Collective</a>, for which thousands of VR cardboard viewers were handed to the public, making it the largest shared public VR experience at the time. A <b>multi-channel soundtrack</b> was overlaid with the live performance on a dedicated sound system surrounding the audience.</p>

<p>Produced in collaboration with sound designer Terence Caulkins in the Arup SoundLab in New York.</p>
