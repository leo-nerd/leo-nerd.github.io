<p>
This monumental sculpture by Prune Nourry at Château La Coste in Provence, France, represents a pregnant woman lying on her back emerging from the land. It was hand-built using locally-sourced clay and the womb is built as a hollow space that visitors can enter.
</p>

<p>
I helped design the interior of the womb space by developing acoustic ray-tracing analyses, and 3D auralizations + visualizations for several options for the internal shaping of the walls.
