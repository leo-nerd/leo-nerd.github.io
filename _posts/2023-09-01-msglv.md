<div class="project-narrative">
<p>
Arup led the full design of the audio and video systems for the immersive bowl, concourse, ancillary, and back of house spaces.
</p>

<p>
I designed the background music and emergency voice evacuation system for the public spaces (bowl, concourse, lounges, and galleries). The system ensures the high-fidelity playback of background music and reliable, uniform, and intelligible broadcast of audio announcements to each of the 18,000 seats in the venue and in the circulation spaces in case of an emergency.
</p>

<p>
The design process involved electroacoustic testing of various loudspeaker transmission through the LED mesh at the Rock Lititz (Lititz, PA) show fabrication facility, and extensive electroacoustic computer modeling of sound levels and intelligibility (STI) to ensure compliance with the fire protection codes, using as few loudspeakers as possible given tight architectural constraints. Redundancies, status monitoring and reporting, and signal priority muting logic were implemented into the back-end audio processing infrastructure to integrate this standalone emergency system to the main event systems and the building fire alarm to ensure public safety.
