---

<p>This video piece was commissioned for the 30th anniversary of Arupâ€™s New York office, as a celebration of its people and landmark projects. It is a data-driven piece generated live from the Arup databases. It features a membership timeline of all current employees of the Arup New York and New Jersey offices, and a generative network mapping their relationships with the projects they've worked on over the years.</p>

<p>Designed and produced in collaboration with Gideo D'Arcangelo, Jessica Wolf, Crystal Butler, Terence Caulkins, Alex Mayo, and Peter Burke at Arup.</p>
