<div class="project-narrative">
<p>
Produced and installed for the <b><i>Water Stories</i></b> exhibition at <a href="https://www.biobatartspace.com/">BioBAT Art Space</a> on display from May 2024 to April 2025, <i><b>Channel</b></i> builds on the work developed by <b>Scope Collective</b> for <a href="https://leonardroussel.com/precipitate"><i>Precipitate</i></a> in 2023.
</p>

<p>
This piece is designed as a playful and introspective path within the BioBAT Art Space centered on 3 large interconnected containers of Gowanus Canal water and living sediment. The space is reconfigured to create an unexpected place of respite, exploration, and conversation around our relationships with the micro-organisms we cohabitate with, featuring large-scale dynamic photographic compositions and multi-layered soundscapes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Scope Collective</b> is comprised of Elizabeth Hénaff, Heather Parrish, Seth Wenger, and myself. Our work emerges from the remarkable microbiome of the Gowanus Canal and the Bay Ridge Channel, as demonstrated by <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/elizabeth-henaff">Pr Hénaff's</a> research. We draw on the relative notions of toxicity and collaboration, the seemingly unsolvable tensions between concurrent time scales, and what it means to survive and evolve alongside other species in urban environments.
