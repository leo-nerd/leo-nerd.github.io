<div class="project-narrative">

<p>
	<a href="https://equipmentroom.com/">Equipment Room</a> is a hi-fi music listening bar located below the Magdalena Hotel in the South Congress district in Austin. Designed by <a href="https://www.rios.com/">RIOS Architects</a>, the bar features an extensive records collection and state-of-the-art audio playback equipment.
</p>
	
<p>
	I worked with Ryan Biziorek at Arup and John Hallock at RIOS to help craft the best listening conditions and patron sonic experience: layout of loudspeakers, choice and placement of acoustic finishes, sound isolation, and AV infrastructure for special events.
